# VoiceBus : Bus Detection App for Visually Impaired

## Background 

Visually impaired users need a simplified and interactive application to quickly check their current bus stop number and arrival timing of their desired bus. Currently most of the existing bus stop applications use voiceover to read out the bus timings and bus stop number. Therefore, to provide a better user experience, we introduce VoiceBus that allows the users to interact with the application and obtain the bus arrival time/bus stop number.



## Features

1. Displays Bus stop based on current location
2. Displays bus timing and bus number of the desired bus 
3. A button to enter your desired bus using speech recognition 
4. Completely accessible using VoiceOver 
5. Receive notifications of the bus arrival (if the app is open in background)
